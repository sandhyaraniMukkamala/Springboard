Internet based shopping is a huge market now. Every one of our needs are only a click away. One of the huge online based shopping sites is Amazon. It is well known for its wide range of products and also has best recommendation system to recommend products to consumers based on their interests and necessity. 

In this project, I am trying to build a similar recommendation engine by taking Amazon Clothes, shoes and jewelry products related dataset into consideration. I am considering ratings and reviews given by users for wide range of products. 

Using KNN(K-nearest neighbor) I am designing item based collaborative filtering model to find similar items.     

Using Logistic Regression performing sentimental analysis for the reviews provided.
